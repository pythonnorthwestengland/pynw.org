We're a small group that's recently reformed so we're not looking to take on sponsorship in a big
way at the moment. However, we could use some support to cover costs and provide food and drink at
our events if possible.

Your company can support Python North West in a small way by buying pizza for one of our events, or
buy a round of drinks at one of our socials.

In return we'll list you as an event sponsor, add your logo and a link to our website and event
listings, and thank you at the event.

If you have any relevant job openings, sponsoring our events would be a great way to share these
with our community and might lead to your next hire from our membership.
